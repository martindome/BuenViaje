Customers who receive a Free Product License shall be required to include the following link on a public area of the Customer's website: https://www.dynamicpdf.com and shall include the following language on each PDF output page "Created using the DynamicPDF Essentials Edition"; 

(iii)	if Customer purchases a subscription license  to the Company Technology ("Subscription License") as reflected in the Product Form; to use the Company Technology as found in, or used to create, the Combined Product and deploy that Combined Product only for the specific number of Developers set forth in the Product Form for a specific period of time.  One Subscription License must be purchased and registered for a specific number of Developers and a specific period of time, as reflected on the Product Form. 

(iv)	if Customer purchases a server license to the Company Technology ("Server License") as reflected in the Product Form; to use the Company Technology as found in, or used to create, a Combined Product and deploy that Combined Product on the number of Production Servers equal to the quantity of Server Licenses purchased and registered to Customer (as reflected in the Product Form and by the receipt of a serial number for each Production Server).  With Server Licenses, Customer does not need a serial number for a server or any machine (either physical or virtual) that is used exclusively for non-Productive Use purposes in connection with the Combined Product; and/or

In some cases, the total number of deployed machines may be limited to a specific number and in other cases may be unlimited.  One Developer License must be purchased and registered to each Developer.

Any rights not expressly granted by Company to Customer are reserved by Company, and all implied licenses are disclaimed.  Without limiting the foregoing, Customer shall not (1) modify, reverse engineer, decompile, create derivative works (except as expressly set forth above); (2) sublicense (except as expressly set forth above), lease, rent, assign, re-package, distribute and/or rebrand the Company Technology as a standalone product except as found in the Combined Product, in which case only as a Combined Product pursuant to a properly executed End User License Agreement and in accordance with the applicable license grant set forth above; (3) port the Company Technology from the platform selected in the Product Form, if any, to another platform; (4) duplicate, sell or reproduce the Company Technology or any portion thereof except as permitted in the applicable license grant set forth above; and/or (5) use the Company Technology to develop, license, sublicense or otherwise make available any product or service that mimics, duplicates, or competes with the features and/or functionality of the Company Technology.  Customer agrees to use the Company Technology in the manner described in the applicable documentation. 
For Subscription Licenses, Company will provide Customer with a serial number, which is then used to create a license key which will be shared by the number of Developers set forth in the Product Form for the Term of the Subscription License.  Customer must maintain a list of all Developers who are using the Company Technology and shall provide such list to Company within five (5) days of request.  Failure to provide a list of Developers when requested shall be a material breach of this Agreement and Company shall have the right to immediate terminate this Agreement and all rights Customer may have hereunder.  Customer is permitted to replace a Developer, at no additional charge, once every one hundred and eighty (180) days.  Upon each replacement, the previous Developer shall cease all use of the Company Technology, shall destroy and/or purge the Company Technology and all copies in any and all forms and from all media and from all devices of the Developer, and upon request from Company, Customer shall certify in writing to Company that they have been destroyed and/or purged and/or provide all relevant documentation concerning the identity of each Developer.

Upon such transfer, the previous Developer shall cease all use of the Company Technology, shall destroy and/or purge the Company Technology and all copies in any and all forms and from all media and from all devices of the Developer, and upon request from Company, Customer shall certify in writing to Company that they have been destroyed and/or purged and/or provide all relevant documentation concerning the identity of each Developer.

Upon request from Company, Customer shall assign any and all rights under the license to Company to permit Company the right to pursue all equitable and legal remedies available.  If Company elects, at its sole discretion, to pursue its rights against such defaulting party, Customer agrees to cooperate with Company in any proceeding against such defaulting party.  Each End User Agreement shall be independent of this Agreement and shall survive termination of this Agreement.
